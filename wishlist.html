                            the wire gets in the way. A new wireless mouse would be a great

                        <p>I love building Lego sets, Some of my favorites right now are the millenium falcon
                        ,colosseum but I think the best/coolest one will be a bunch of those mini lego architecture
                        sets for each of the cities I've been to.</p>

                        <p>I like my headphones, but it's probally not really good for my ears, so when I'm just 
                            listening to music at home but I really want to get that full sound experience, a good
                            speaker would be really nice.

                        <p>I lose stuff quite a lot! And I'm surprised I still don't have airtags considering 
                            how useful they are for finding lost items. And it isn't just lost things, sometimes
                            I know I put something somewhere but I just can't remember where.

                        <p>I have a lot of devices that need charging, and having it all in one place without
                            any clutter would be really nice. Plus I would like to use the iphone magsafe standby
                            mode more often because it's quite nice and really useful,

                    <p>I'm getting into more CAD and 3d modelling, so a 3d printer would be really nice to
                        see my designs come to life. Plus I could make some cool stuff too! Bamboo lab has a lot
                        of options and I'm honestly fine with any of them   .

                    <p>Right now I'm using a 2023 Powerbook HP laptop, which is doing <i>alright</i> I guess,
                        but I would like to get a Macbook Air or a framework Laptop. I think both of them
                        would be a great upgrade for me.

                    <p>My current iPhone is an iPhone XR, which is still a good phone, but the new iPhone 17
                        looks really cool and has a lot of new features that I would like to try out.
                        Plus the camera is probably a lot better than my current phone.
